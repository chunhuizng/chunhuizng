### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chunhui Zhang, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at DartmouthðŸŒ², working with [ðŸŒŸProfessor Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/). I hold an MSCS degree from Brandeis University, where I was honored with the GSAS Fellowship, and a Bachelor's degree in CS from Northeastern University, receiving the Outstanding Honor Thesis Award.

ðŸ”­ My research investigates the intrinsic properties of deep learning across diverse modalities, aiming to drive trustworthy real-world applications. Some of my key works include:
- Efficient Vision-Language Generation in Large Model [(in submission)](#)
- Inherent robustness of Mixture-of-Experts [ICLR](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7jk5gWjC18M)
- Meta learning on relational structures [TMLR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LEVbhNrLEL)
- Low-dimensionality in self-supervised training data: [ICML](https://openreview.net/for[um?id=3jV525Hmqr) & [NeurIPS](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rg_yN3HpCp)
- Emergence of language concepts in compact vision models [CIKM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3511808.3557382)

Feel free to explore these links for a deeper insight into my work and contributions to the field.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focused on expanding my research in machine learning and artificial intelligence, especially in areas that intersect with real-world applications.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborations in research projects that align with my interests, particularly those that push the boundaries of machine learning and AI.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my research, machine learning, and the journey in academia. I'm always excited to share insights and learn from others' experiences.

âš¡ Fun fact: Outside of research, I enjoy racing - go-karting and circuit racing are some of my favorite activities. I'm also looking forward to trying rally driving someday!
